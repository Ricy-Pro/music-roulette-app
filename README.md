🎵 Music Roulette 🎵
Music Roulette is a fun, multiplayer game where players guess whose song is playing! Each player contributes songs from their music library, and the game randomly selects one track per round. The goal is for each player to vote and guess which other player the song belongs to, earning points for correct guesses. The game is timed and progresses through several rounds, with scores accumulating until a winner is crowned!
